      <p>Who that cares much to know the history of man, and how the mysterious mixture behaves
        under
        the varying experiments of Time, has not dwelt, at least briefly, on the life of Saint
        Theresa,
        has not smiled with some gentleness at the thought of the little girl walking forth
        one morning
        hand-in-hand with her still smaller brother, to go and seek martyrdom in the country
        of the
        Moors? Out they toddled from rugged Avila, wide-eyed and helpless-looking as two fawns,
        but with
        human hearts, already beating to a national idea; until domestic reality met them
        in the shape
        of uncles, and turned them back from their great resolve. That child­pilgrimage was
        a fit
        beginning. Theresa's passionate, ideal nature demanded an epic life: what were many-volumed
        romances of chivalry and the social conquests of a brilliant girl to her? Her </p>

      <hr>
      <p><b>2</b></p>

      <p>flame quickly burned up that light fuel; and, fed from within, soared after some illimitable
        satisfaction, some object which would never justify weariness, which would reconcile
        self-despair with the rapturous consciousness of life beyond self. She found her epos
        in the
        reform of a religious order. </p>


      <p>That Spanish woman who lived three hundred years ago, was certainly not the last of
        her kind.
        Many Theresas have been born who found for them selves no epic life wherein there
        was a constant
        unfolding of far-resonant action; perhaps only a life of mistakes, the offspring of
        a certain
        spiritual grandeur ill-matched with the meanness of opportunity; perhaps a tragic
        failure which
        found no sacred poet and sank unwept into oblivion. With dim lights and tangled circumstance
        they tried to shape their thought and deed in noble agreement; but after all, to common
        eyes
        their struggles seemed mere inconsistency and formlessness; for these later-born Theresas
        were
        helped by no coherent social faith and order which could perform the function of knowledge
        for
        the ardently willing soul. Their ardour alternated between a vague ideal and the common
        yearning
        of womanhood; so that the one was disapproved as extravagance, and the other condemned
        as a
        lapse. </p>


      <p>Some have felt that these blundering lives are due to the inconvenient indefiniteness
        with
        which the Supreme Power has fashioned the natures of women: if there were one level
        of feminine
        incompetence as strict as the ability to count three and no more, the social lot of
        women might
        be treated with </p>

      <hr>
      <p class="centered"><b>3</b></p>

      <p>scientific certitude. Meanwhile the indefiniteness remains, and the limits of variation
        are
        really much wider than any one would imagine from the sameness of women's coiffure
        and the
        favourite love-stories in prose and verse. Here and there a cygnet is reared uneasily
        among the
        ducklings in the brown pond, and never finds the living stream in fellowship with
        its own
        oary-footed kind. Here and there is born a Saint Theresa, foundress of nothing, whose
        loving
        heart-beats and sobs after an unattained goodness tremble off and are dispersed among
        hindrances, instead of centering in some long-recognisable deed. </p>

      <p>Miss Brooke had that kind of beauty which seems to be thrown into relief by poor dress.
        Her
        hand and wrist were so finely formed that she could wear sleeves not less bare of
        style than
        those in which the Blessed Virgin appeared to Italian painters; and her profile as
        well as her
        stature and bearing seemed to gain the more dignity from her plain garments, which
        by the side
        of provincial fashion gave her the impressiveness of a fine quotation from the Bible,—or
        from
        one of our elder poets,—in a paragraph of to-day's newspaper. She was usually spoken
        of as being
        remarkably clever, but with the addition that her sister Celia had more common­sense.
        Nevertheless, Celia wore scarcely more trimmings; and it was only to close observers
        that her
        dress differed from her sister's, and had a shade of coquetry in its arrangements;
        for Miss
        Brooke's plain dressing was due to mixed conditions, in most of which her sister shared.
        The
        pride of being ladies </p>

      <hr>
      <p class="centered"><b>8</b></p>

      <p>had something to do with it: the Brooke connections, though not exactly aristocratic,
        were
        unquestionably "good:" if you inquired backward for a generation or two, you would
        not find any
        yard­measuring or parcel-tying forefathers anything lower than an admiral or a clergyman;
        and
        there was even an ancestor discernible as a Puritan gentleman who served under Cromwell,
        but
        afterwards conformed, and managed to come out of all political troubles as the proprietor
        of a
        respectable family estate. Young women of such birth, living in a quiet country-house,
        and
        attending a village church hardly larger than a parlour, naturally regarded frippery
        as the
        ambition of a huckster's daughter. Then there was well-bred economy, which in those
        days made
        show in dress the first item to be deducted from, when any margin was required for
        expenses more
        distinctive of rank. Such reasons would have been enough to account for plain dress,
        quite apart
        from religious feeling; but in Miss Brooke's case, regligion alone would have determined
        it; and
        Celia mildly acquiesced in all her sister's sentiments, only infusing them with that
        common-sense which is able to accept momentous doctrines without any eccentric agitation.
        Dorothea knew many passages of Pascal's Pensees and of Jeremy Taylor by heart; and
        to her the
        destinies of mankind, seen by the light of Christianity, made the solicitudes of feminine
        fashion appear an occupation for Bedlam. She could not reconcile the anxieties of
        a spiritual
        life involving eternal conse quences, with a keen interest in guimp and artificial

      <p>protrusions of drapery. Her mind was theoretic, and yearned by its nature after some
        lofty
        conception of the world which might frankly include the parish of Tipton and her own
        rule of
        conduct there; she was enamoured of intensity and greatness, and rash in embracing
        whatever
        seemed to her to have those aspects; likely to seek martyrdom, to make retractations,
        and then
        to incur martyrdom after all in a quarter where she had not sought it. Certainly such
        elements
        in the character of a marriageable girl tended to interfere with her lot, and hinder
        it from
        being decided according to custom, by good looks, vanity, and merely canine affection.
        With all
        this, she, the elder of the sisters, was not yet twenty, and they had both been educated,
        since
        they were about twelve years old and had lost their parents, on plans at once narrow
        and
        promiscuous, first in an English family and afterwards in a Swiss family at Lausanne,
        their
        bachelor uncle and guardian trying in this way to remedy the disadvantages of their
        orphaned
        condition. </p>


      <p>It was hardly a year since they had come to live at Tipton Grange with their uncle,
        a man
        nearly sixty, of acquiescent temper, miscellaneous opinions, and uncertain vote. He
        had
        travelled in his younger years, and was held in this part of the county to have contracted
        a too
        rambling habit of mind. Mr Brooke's conclusions were as difficult to predict as the
        weather: it
        was only safe to say that he would act with benevolent intentions, and that he would
        spend as
        little money as possible in carrying them out. For the most glutinously indefinite

      <p>minds enclose some hard grains of habit; and a man has been seen lax about all his
        own
        interests except the retention of his snuff-box, concerning which he was watchful,
        suspicious,
        and greedy of clutch. </p>


      <p>In Mr Brooke the hereditary strain of Puritan energy was clearly in abeyance; but
        in his niece
        Dorothea it glowed alike through faults and virtues, turning sometimes into impatience
        of her
        uncle's talk or his way of "letting things be" on his estate, and making her long
        all the more
        for the time when she would be of age and have some command of money for generous
        schemes. She
        was regarded as an heiress; for not only had the sisters seven hundred a-year each
        from their
        parents, but if Dorothea married and had a son, that son would inherit Mr Brooke's
        estate,
        presumably worth about three thousand a-year - a rental which seemed wealth to provincial
        families, still discussing Mr Peel's late conduct on the Catholic question, innocent
        of future
        gold-fields, and of that gorgeous plutocracy which has so nobly exalted the necessities
        of
        genteel life. </p>


      <p>And how should Dorothea not marry?—a girl so handsome and with such prospects? Nothing
        could
        hinder it but her love of extremes, and her insistance on regulating life according
        to notions
        which might cause a wary man to hesitate before he made her an offer, or even might
        lead her at
        last to refuse all offers. A young lady of some birth and fortune, who knelt suddenly
